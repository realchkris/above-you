## 👓 Introduction
A work-in-progress web application that provides real-time information on **celestial objects**, **weather conditions**, and **ISS flyovers** given the user's location.

## 🚩 Project Scope

Core Features (MVP):
- Detect user location using the Geolocation API.
- Fetch and display real-time weather and sky visibility data using Open-Meteo API.
- Retrieve and display visible celestial objects from AstronomyAPI.
- Show ISS flyover times based on location using WhereTheISS.at API.


Optional Features:
- Allow users to save locations to check sky conditions elsewhere.
- Implement a basic backend (Node.js + Express) to store user preferences.
- User authentication.
- Data visualization for past sky conditions.
