## 👓 Introduction
A work-in-progress web application that provides real-time information on **celestial objects**, **weather conditions**, and **International Space Station flyovers** based on the user's geolocation.

## 🚩 Project Scope

### Core Features:
- Detect user location using Geolocation and track it real-time.
- Fetch and display real-time weather and sky visibility data via Open-Meteo.
- Retrieve and display visible celestial objects via AstronomyAPI.
- Show where the ISS is at using the WhereTheISS.at API, and calculate the distance from the user in real-time.

### Additional Features (WIP):
- Sign up/Login.
- Save locations + show relative data elsewhere.
